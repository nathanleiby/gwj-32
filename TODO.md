- [ ] make it winnable / loseable
  - [ ] fix bug transitioning to GameOver screen
- [ ] share it

Nice to have

- [ ] Show damage dealt more clearly (e.g. show damage per card + summary of damage), same idea for armor / healing

Programming stuff

- abstract out lots of key params into a consts / globals files
- event bus, signals
- think through core game state (Player properties, current level, score, etc)
- controller input
- multiplayer

Deploy

- [ ] automatically deploy latest build to itch  https://hub.docker.com/r/barichello/godot-ci , https://gitlab.com/barichello/godot-ci/
