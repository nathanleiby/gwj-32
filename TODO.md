# Todo List

## Now


- [ ] make it winnable / loseable
- [ ] fix bug transitioning to GameOver screen

## Actionable

- show cost to trash a card
- add a "how to play" screen
- share it with `#gamedev` discord for feedback v1

## Backlog

- Show damage dealt more clearly (e.g. show damage per card + summary of damage), same idea for armor / healing
- Fix non-ideal UX:  remove need for "refresh" button in econ screen
- abstract out lots of key params into a consts / globals files
- event bus, signals
- think through core game state (Player properties, current level, score, etc)
- controller input
- automatically deploy latest build to itch  https://hub.docker.com/r/barichello/godot-ci , https://gitlab.com/barichello/godot-ci/

## Need clarity

- Make the battle more exciting
- co-op multiplayer
