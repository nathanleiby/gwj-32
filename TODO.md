# Todo List

## Now

- Show damage dealt more clearly (e.g. show damage per card + summary of damage), same idea for armor / healing
- select levels

## Actionable

- show cost to trash a card
- share it with `#gamedev` discord for feedback v1

## Backlog

- add ability to heal (bought at shop)
- Fix non-ideal UX:  remove need for "refresh" button in econ screen
- abstract out lots of key params into a consts / globals files
- event bus, signals
- think through core game state (Player properties, current level, score, etc)
- controller input
- automatically deploy latest build to itch  https://hub.docker.com/r/barichello/godot-ci , https://gitlab.com/barichello/godot-ci/
- load game params, cards, etc from CSV/JSON https://youtu.be/MHeMxiDwo4o?t=523

## Need clarity

- Make the battle more exciting
- co-op multiplayer
