Nice to have

- [ ] Show damage dealt more clearly (e.g. show damage per card + summary of damage), same idea for armor / healing

Programming stuff

- abstract out lots of key params into a consts / globals files
- event bus, signals
- think through core game state (Player properties, current level, score, etc)
- controller input
- multiplayer
