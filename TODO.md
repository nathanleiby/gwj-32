- Create the "econ" scene
    * choosing card(s) to add to your deck (varible cost)
    * trashing cards (increasing cost per trashed card, possible decrease per round), healing
    * growing your queue (increasing cost per slot)
- Create the overall game flow
  - 7 levels of combat + econ
  - after (as) 7th level, a big boss battle
    * idea: boss should mess with your queue somehow .. e.g. "disable" a card, lock a card in a position, etc
