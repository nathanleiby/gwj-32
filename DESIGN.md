## Concept

Mind flayer: "Something is missing" from my life. I've only ever felt part of the hive mind (Elder Brain), and I want to know what other emotions are like!

...the mindflayers are millenials? They need emotional fulfillment out of their work, not just at 9-to-5 as part of the hive mind.

> these alien humanoid-looking beings sought to expand their dominion over all other creatures, controlling their minds to use them as hopeless slaves and devouring their brains for sustenance.[2]
