Design
====

- Create the "econ" scene
    * choosing card(s) to add to your deck (varible cost)
    * trashing cards (increasing cost per trashed card, possible decrease per round), healing
    * growing your queue (increasing cost per slot)
- Create the overall game flow
  - 7 levels of combat + econ
  - after (as) 7th level, a big boss battle
    * idea: boss should mess with your queue somehow .. e.g. "disable" a card, lock a card in a position, etc
  - perhaps Megaman style: 7 dungeons each with a boss + a metal

Game outline

- add a game over and game victory screen
- add a HUD (coins, health,etc) that persists

Gameplay parameters to explore

- starting HP
- enemies and their stats / attack styles
- cards you can buy (e.g. number of cards in shop)
- shop timer
- how much money you make per round
- add new cards
- add ability to heal (else you gon die fast)
  - healing potion (in deck, single use?)
  - healing dance (in deck, multi use)
- allow selling/trashing cards in deck
- deck max size
- ability to grow your queue
- tick speed (for excitement, mainly)
  - music that aligns with it
- first pass on music and sound fx
- multiplayer interaction (idea: 4 sided table, and you can see your queues aligning)
  - draw connections between them for cool viz
  - put enemy/monster(s) in middle of screen
- game win condition (e.g. complete in 7m, beat levels, etc)
- mechanics that make the queue and autobattling more fun
- side board? quick battle setup based on enemy type?
- Should enemy be a queue as well? or simpler / easier to understand?




IDEATION

- could each queue slot have a level, and higher level cards only trigger if it's upgraded enough?
  - Or you can specialized, e.g. lock a slot, get a bonus to certain types of cards, etc
    - e.g. bronze queue slot enhances other bronze cards
