## April 13

7:30 pm - how it looks
![](2021-04-13-19-36-24.png)

- trying to make card choices more tactical and engaging. Adding first cards to use "queue" based mechanics.
- with the "debug deck" (1 of each card), I was able to squeak through level 4 and died immediately on level 5.

## April 12 @ 11:50pm

- dying consistenly on level 4.
  - seems like monster difficulty scales up too fast.
  - there's no way to heal.

## April 12 @ 6pm

- with base HP of 99, was dying on level 6
- some buginess with how armor worked
- too much gold as well, need a way to spend (e.g. expand the queue)
